# PasswordGenerator
This will be a password generator application.

In this application, I made a password generator that can generate a password between 8 to 128 characters and whether or not to include uppercase or lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Once the password is generated, the user can then decide to click on the clipboard icon to copy the password for other uses.

The container for the generator can adapt to different heights and widths for different devices. 

I struggled with aligning the clipboard image into a button but couldn't figure out how to directly correlate the html with js. Also, I couldn't figure out how to make the max out the length of the passoword to 128 characters. There is no specific max.

I have provided different executions within the javascript.
