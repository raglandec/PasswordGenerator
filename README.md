# PasswordGenerator

# Running Text
In this application, I made a password generator that can generate a password between 8 to 128 characters and whether or not to include uppercase or lowercase letters, special characters, and numbers. Once the password is generated, the user can then decide to click on the clipboard icon to copy the password for other uses.

The container for the generator can adapt to different heights and widths for different devices. I have provided explanations of different executions within the javascript.
